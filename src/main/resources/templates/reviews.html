	<h1>Welcome to Macharia's Reviews site</h1>

	<p>
		Online review sites have transformed the way we do business and the way customers make decisions.</p>
		Why the appeal of review sites? They offer consumers the ability to rave about your restaurant or talk bad about it.
		It makes them feel better to post it online.
	<p>
		Additionally, review sites help your potential customers weed out their choices. Reviews help them decide if they are
		going to stop into your restaurant or the competitions.
		Public opinion has taken over the Internet, and if you are not currently perusing review sites, it is time to find out
		what your customers think.
